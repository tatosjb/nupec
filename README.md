# Man, why you do that?? Are you crazy???
No, I am not crazy, this project is for a public school project, named NuPeC. This is for jornalism and programming classes improve their own skills. I will finish this first version, then they'll go to the field!!

`Who idealized this NuPeC project?`
The idealizer is [**Carlos Bartolomeu da Silva Filho**](https://www.facebook.com/mentorfazdeconta). The project was born from a bet between him and a student.

If you want to help, feel free to talk with me or him.

# Why english?
I think english is a very important skill to them, then I make myself as an example to prove my conviction.

# Wordpress theme
Based on https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/blog/

# How to execute this project?
1 - Install docker and docker-compose using [official docker install docs(ubuntu)](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and [official docker-compose install docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) then, just run `docker-compose up`.

2 - Wait until the environment goes up, then access http://localhost:8080 to execute installation steps.

3 - After you end up the second step, access http://localhost:8080/wp-admin, log in with your credentials(remember from step 2) and go to `Appearance -> Themes`, then select `Activate` on theme named `nupec`

Done! Now access localhost:8080 and have fun.
