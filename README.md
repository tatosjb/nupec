# Man, why you do that?? Are you crazy???
No, am i not crazy, this project is for a public school project, called NuPeC. This is for jornalism and programmig classes improve their own skills. I will finish this first version, then they go to the field!!

`Who idealized this NuPeC project?`
The idealizer is [**Carlos Bartolomeu da Silva Filho**](https://www.facebook.com/mentorfazdeconta). The project was born from a bet between him and a student.

If you want to help feel free to talk with me or him.

# Why english?
I think english is a very important skill to them, then i make myself as example to prove my conviction.
